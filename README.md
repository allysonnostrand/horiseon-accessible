The goal for this webpage was to improve accessibility. Some changes that I have made to reach the goal includes...

Spaced out code in the html file so it was easier to read. 

Added alt attributes to all images. 

Changed title to be more descriptive. 

# CSS
Consolidated redundant CSS selectors and properties.

Created comments to organize and be more user friendly.

Re-organized to follow semantic structure.
